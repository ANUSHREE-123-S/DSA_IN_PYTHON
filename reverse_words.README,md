1. Use `strip()` to remove leading/trailing spaces.  
2. Use `split()` to separate words (ignores multiple spaces).  
3. Reverse the list of words.  
4. Join them back with a single space.  
## ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` (traverses string once)  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` (stores words in a list)  
## 📝 Code
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.strip().split()
        words.reverse()
        return " ".join(words)
