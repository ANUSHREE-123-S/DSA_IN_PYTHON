# 🌳 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree (BST)

## 🧩 Problem Description
Given a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, find the **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** of two given nodes `p` and `q`.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia:  
> “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

**Explanation:**  
Since node 2 is an ancestor of node 4, the LCA of 2 and 4 is 2.

## 💡 Approach — BST Property Traversal

In a **Binary Search Tree**, the left child is smaller and the right child is larger than the parent node.

We can use this property to efficiently find the **Lowest Common Ancestor** by moving down the tree:
1. If both `p` and `q` are smaller than `root`, the LCA lies in the **left subtree**.
2. If both `p` and `q` are greater than `root`, the LCA lies in the **right subtree**.
3. Otherwise, `root` is the LCA (when `p` and `q` are on different sides or equal to `root`).

## ✅ Code Implementation

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        while root:
            # If both nodes are smaller, move left
            if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
                root = root.left
            # If both nodes are larger, move right
            elif p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
                root = root.right
            # Split point found — this is the LCA
            else:
                return root
